# MASTERMIND GAME

## 1. BACKGROUND
It is a code-breaking game for two players invented in Isareal. The game consists of a codebreaker and a codemaker. The code-maker will arrange 4 colours in some position for the code-breaker to solve. Each time the code-breaker can make a guess and the code-maker can give information about how many of the guessed colour are in the correct order.

## 2.About the program

The main aim of our program is to help the code-breaker player to solve the problem in the most optimal way (minimum number of guesses) by using an A.I system to make inference about the logic if enough information is provided. The program uses inference system after every guess made by the player to figure out whether a solution could be found given existing evidence.
